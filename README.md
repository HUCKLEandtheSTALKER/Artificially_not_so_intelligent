# Artificially_not_so_intelligent

The computer program is only as intelligent as the person who wrote the code, unfortunately.

The goal of this project is to use machine learning to analyse data of some sort, in order to create a model to make predictions.
To learn how to do this, I've been following along with the popular stanford machine learning course from Andrew Ng.
Thus you'll also find a collection of more basic machine learning programs related to lessons in this course.
